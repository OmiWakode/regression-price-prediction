# regression-price-prediction
A machine learning model that predicts the Sales Prices of bulldozers.

The data set was downloaded from Kaggle. [Kaggle bluebook for bulldozers competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)
This model predicts the Sales Price of bulldozers with date range May 1, 2012 - November 2012. 
The training set of the data contains data through the end of 2011, and validation data set contains data for saleprice between Jan 2012- April 2012.This totals of approx 412,000
data rows. 
This project used RandomForestRegressor for predicting the Sale Price. The best rslme (root mean squared log error) was found to be 0.256
